    "summary": "I'm from Newton, Massachusetts and have been in the Boston area for most of my life. I went to Milton Academy where I helped grow the school's programming department from 40 people to 120 people (in a school of 800). I was instrumental in the founding of the school's programming club and tutoring system. I currently attend Northeastern University where I study Computer Science. I'm very interested in tutoring, entrepreneurship, and programming (of course!) I'm part of Northeastern's NUHacks club whose mission is to help student make cool things for the purpose of making cool things (a mission near and dear to my heart.) I was recently elected a NUHacks board member.",
