    "summary": "I'm from Newton, Massachusetts and attended Milton Academy where I founded the school’s Programming Club and Computer Science tutoring system. During my tenure at Milton, I helped grow the school’s Programming department from 40 to 120 students, in a school of 800. I currently attend Northeastern University as a sophomore, where I major in Computer Science and I'm very interested in tutoring, entrepreneurship, and programming. I was recently elected to the Board of Directors of Northeastern's NUHacks club - whose mission is to help students make, break, hack, design, build and other creative-type things, which is a mission near and dear to my heart. I am also a Program Director in Northeastern’s Entrepreneur's Club, responsible for Connect and TechTreks, where I make connections between NU's budding entrepreneurs and the venture capital startup community in the Boston area.",
