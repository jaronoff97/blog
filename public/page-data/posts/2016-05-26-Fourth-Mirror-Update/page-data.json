This is my fourth post involving my smart mirror project!</p>\n<p>Sorry I haven’t had a post recently, all of my work last week was non-post related. I’ve been working on my mirror’s software. I’ve got facial recognition working really well, it can recognize as many faces as there are in a picture with very good accuracy. I’ve also got finger recognition working well, it’s not near as good as facial recognition but its alright. </p>\n<p>I’ve been working on the art components of the project now. The first one is overlaying an image on a face. The easy part was putting the image on a face, the hard part is the transparency. Because the transparency requires a fourth, alpha channel the bitwise image addition cannot be made. </p>\n<p>I think I’m going to take a break on the image and work on a different component: randomly generated mazes. Thanks for reading.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2016-05-26-Fourth-Mirror-Update/","tagSlugs":["/tag/post/","/tag/update/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","description":"OpenCV installed.","tags":["post","update"],"title":"Fourth Mirror Update"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/2016-05-26-Fourth-Mirror-Update/"}}}
