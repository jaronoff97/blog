It took a while to actually figure out the ops behind it, but I finally figured it out and did it! Even though I deployed it, I can’t celebrate just yet; I have to test the crap out of it, and gradually enable different aspects of the service during the next couple of weeks. For the next week I’m going to be planning different events for my team to help test the service and find bugs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"tech-talk-8-samantha-john\"><a href=\"#tech-talk-8-samantha-john\" aria-label=\"tech talk 8 samantha john permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tech Talk 8: Samantha John</h2>\n<p>Today the CEO/ Founder of Hopscotch, a platform for learning programming meant as a more in depth and interactive version of scratch with lessons and a sharing platform built in. Her talk was more of a chat; there wasn’t that much structure, which i really appreciated because i got to ask her a bunch of questions. One of the mentors for her conmpany is Alan Kay, the founder of Smalltalk (basically the predecessor for many modern languages). Alan Kay is a personal hero of mine because he changed the face of programming with his language. He came up with many concepts for languages and programming that we still use to this day. She also gave me some advice on starting a company, which I am planning on doing VERY VERY soon!!!

Chris interviewed her by using her book (another one to add to my list) as a guide. Her talk was very interesting, but i wished i had read her book prior to the talk (most people hadn’t either though)</p>\n<h2 id=\"fourth-of-july-weekend\"><a href=\"#fourth-of-july-weekend\" aria-label=\"fourth of july weekend permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fourth of July weekend</h2>\n<p>This weekend I went to Martha’s Vineyard with my parents and some friends, we’re building a place here and it’s very close to being finished!!! The vineyard gave me a chance to just cool down a bit and take some much needed relaxation time. I read more of Cathy O’Neil’s book, which again i think everyone should read, and I kept being amazed by everything she said; it’s unbelievable how many algorithms take advantage of the average American. I also talked with my friend about starting a company, and we’re going to do it!!! More on that later once we actually incorperate, that being said, I could not be more excited to start this new chapter in my life; a founder. </p>\n<h2 id=\"soundtrack-for-the-week\"><a href=\"#soundtrack-for-the-week\" aria-label=\"soundtrack for the week permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Soundtrack for the Week</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYkjt9F81c\">The End of Comedy</a> - Drugdealer</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sao2tnp5KMk&#x26;list=PLuElwtKolKAOtoahfJSu7W6seCV3Xh44L\">Coming of Age</a> - Ben Williams</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2017-07-03-HackNY-Week-5/","tagSlugs":["/tag/hack-ny/","/tag/review/","/tag/summer/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Deploy time!","tags":["HackNY","review","summer"],"title":"HackNY Week 5"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/2017-07-03-HackNY-Week-5/"}}}
