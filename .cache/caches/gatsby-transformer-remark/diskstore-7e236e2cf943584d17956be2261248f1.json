This past week was pretty fun, I enjoyed getting the chance to use R’s interesting type system. Our assignment this week was to basically convert string -> datetime -> int -> datetime. I did this in a pretty interesting way. First, I made a new column in the data frame which represented the “Posix” version of the string in the “date” column. I then checked that the class of the data in the column was what I expected. The class was what I anticipated “Posixt” and “Posixct”. I then  set the class of the new column equal to the class of an integer. By doing so, I was now able to compare the datetimes like normal integers. This was a really interesting and weird approach that could only be done in a language like R.
