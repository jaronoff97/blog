There’s a lot of openly available data about reddit that I’ll be able to scrape. Recently, there was a brief study posted on FiveThirtyEight doing what he called “Reddit Algebra”, which was actually just a fancier way of explaining set operations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/\">FiveThirtyEight Article</a></p>\n<p>For the past couple of weeks in my weekly reviews, I’ve talked a lot about analyzing reddit data to generate predictions or statistics. What I want to do with this project, is take the basics of what the aformentioned person did, and go one step further. Here would be my process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get large reddit data set (available on the web)</li>\n<li>Store it in MySQL (data is already in SQL format)</li>\n<li>Write GraphQL schema to connect code to DB</li>\n<li>\n<p>Construct GQL queries given params</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User inputs reddit username</li>\n<li>GQL query gets the subreddits that user has commented on, and truncates it into a number for each subreddit</li>\n<li>Get users who have commented the most on the places where the given user has also commented</li>\n<li>Aggregate the subreddits the other users have also commented on, returning a list of suggested subreddits</li>\n<li>I can also add in the ability to find subreddits like a given subreddit, listing other subreddits ordered by their %similarity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MySQL backend</li>\n<li>GraphQL middleware</li>\n<li>Node.js frontend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The end goal of my project will be the following: given a reddit username suggest other subreddits that user may like, or given a subreddit, give a list of subreddits similar. I would accomplish this using collaborative filtering.</p>"}
