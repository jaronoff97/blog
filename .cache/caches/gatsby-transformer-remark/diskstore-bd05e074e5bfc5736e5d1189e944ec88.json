What a great game tonight! I’m really interested in the statistics and probability behind the game. I was looking into what sort of data I can get online and actually found a couple data sources. According to one article I found, the ball was only in play for a total of 16 minutes and 14 seconds. <a href=\"http://supplementreviews.com/articles/entertainment/ball-in-play-for-a-total-of-387\">Link to article</a> </p>\n<p>What I was more interested in, however, was the probability of the game. I wish there was a website with real time predictions where you could see the chances of a given outcome. When the Pats were down 28-3, the chances for them to come back we’re impossibly small. I recall hearing a newcaster state that they’re chances were as close to zero as possible. After every touchdown, I was more and more surprised that what I was watching was possible.</p>\n<p>I’m very interested to see more data reports that come from this game. I was just reading an article about the game from Five Thirty Eight. The article had some really interested visualizations of just how good Tom Brady is. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/morris-sb-1-chad.png?quality=90&#x26;strip=all&#x26;w=575&#x26;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tom Brady Super Bowls\"></p>\n<p>It’s very cool that Brady came back from the largest deficit in history. Overall, I’m very excited to learn more about this momentous event in history. Hopefully the NFL open sources some of their data.</p>"}
