He was also used to introduce Ghost Rider, which was AMAZING, I really hope we see him again in season 5, cause damn was he badass. AIDA and Radcliffe though really stole the show with all the levels of trickery going on there. It was so refreshing to be confused during the show, and to not be able to predict what was going to happen next. In many ways I actually liked the portrayal of AI via AIDA more than via ultron, because it showed that even a calculated approach can go haywire very quickly in that world. I think my least favorite part of the season was the ending with AIDA getting killed by coulson, I think it would have felt a bit more poetic if it had been fitz who ultimately killed her.

I feel like what could have made this season better was simply a little bit more of a focused plot and some better acting. Jessica’s transformation from grungy into depressed alcoholic like she is now was really enthralling though. They did set up Trish pretty well though as the villain for the next season, and I think that’s going to be very interesting.","position":{"start":{"line":322,"column":1,"offset":27797},"end":{"line":322,"column":817,"offset":28613},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":322,"column":1,"offset":27797},"end":{"line":322,"column":817,"offset":28613},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":344,"column":1,"offset":28635}}}}
