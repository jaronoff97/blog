I was also excited to learn more about the different kinds of NoSQL store management such as key-value, graph, columnar, and document. I’m very interested in data pipelines, and I think in my project I’m going to use a graph storage system to represent my data. Either that or a document store. </p>\n<p>I’ve been more and more interested in data science recently, and one of my favorite subreddits has become <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/data\">r/dataisbeautiful</a>. The entire community is based around people sharing interesting data sets and visualizations. The data sets range from government data, to scientific analysis, and other random clusters. Recently someone did a study about their mouse movements. I think I’m going to do a study about the most commonly clicked keys on my keyboard. From there I’ll also be able to do analysis on the most common words I type, the most common ngrams in my sentences, and more. </p>\n<p>This week I plan to sit down and brainstorm more about what i want to do for my data science project. I think the reddit project is going to be a relatively simple project to map out on paper, and then I’ll run into some other challenges in storing and visualizing my data. I also want to open it up so that anyone can use the data for their own visualizations. I bet that there are plenty of redditors who would benefit from a place to make their visualizaions. </p>\n<p>That’s all im going to write about for now, this week was short so I’m going to make a short post :P</p>"}
