Looking back at the whole season, I see the use of Eli Morrow, but in the moment I was really tired of his whole subplot. He was needed as an element to introduce the darkhold, and eventually AIDA. He was also used to introduce Ghost Rider, which was AMAZING, I really hope we see him again in season 5, cause damn was he badass. AIDA and Radcliffe though really stole the show with all the levels of trickery going on there. It was so refreshing to be confused during the show, and to not be able to predict what was going to happen next. In many ways I actually liked the portrayal of AI via AIDA more than via ultron, because it showed that even a calculated approach can go haywire very quickly in that world. I think my least favorite part of the season was the ending with AIDA getting killed by coulson, I think it would have felt a bit more poetic if it had been fitz who ultimately killed her. OH and that reminds me the bit between Fitz’s LMD and Jemma was so amazing because you could just see the emotion that both characters were putting into the role.
