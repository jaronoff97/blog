More than anything, he was interested in how things on the internet went viral; what makes people want to share content with their friends? It was that kind of connection that drove him to teach media studies, and eventually found Buzzfeed (which spawned out of a huffington post lab). It was great hearing the story of such a succesful founder’s story, beacuse it was very different than i had anticipated. Buzzfeed, being the well known company that it is, comes with a certain reputation. My perception of buzzfeed changed such that I now understand that they focus on finding what connects people in this new world, and how do we as a society like to relate to one another; it’s definetly an interesting thought experiment.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":880},"end":{"line":12,"column":992,"offset":1871}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":880},"end":{"line":12,"column":992,"offset":1871}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"weekend-photoshooting"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"#weekend-photoshooting","aria-label":"weekend photoshooting permalink","class":"anchor"},"children":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]},{"type":"text","value":"Weekend Photoshooting","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":4,"offset":1876},"end":{"line":14,"column":25,"offset":1897}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":1873},"end":{"line":14,"column":25,"offset":1897}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Sean and I went all around lower manhattan taking pictures of some very interesting and weird buildings/ locations around the city.
