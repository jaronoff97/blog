She is a very outspoken voice, and quite honestly one that we need to hear more of. In the past years and in the very close future, more and more of the algorithms that make important decisions have been/ will be left unchecked. It was interesting to hear her thoughts on many of the things that have gone wrong in recent years and steps we should be taking to prevent algorithms from having no oversight. I’m excited to finish her book, as i love learning more abotu the current issues in america and around the world.
