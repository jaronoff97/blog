For her birthday we went to an amazing sushi restaurant where she, her boyfriend, and I did omakase (chef’s choice); my parents and my sister’s best friend were not up to the challenge. This was probably the best sushi of my life; I had to be very adventurous, I tried raw scallop, king crab, etc. In addition to that, it was also pride weekend, which was really cool to experience! I’m glad to live in a place where people are very accepting of others. </p>\n<h2 id=\"tech-talk-6-cancelled\"><a href=\"#tech-talk-6-cancelled\" aria-label=\"tech talk 6 cancelled permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tech Talk 6: CANCELLED</h2>\n<p>R.I.P.

Ann’s talk was about how their firm focuses on what they call “Prime Movers”. These are people who make the real changes in the world; the people they care about investing in. She also talked about what’s important when investing. I always love meeting VC’s because each of them bring their own new perspective to something I’ve been learning about my whole life. </p>\n<h2 id=\"yume-wo-katare-and-ramen-lab\"><a href=\"#yume-wo-katare-and-ramen-lab\" aria-label=\"yume wo katare and ramen lab permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Yume Wo Katare and Ramen Lab</h2>\n<p>Yume Wo Katare is my favorite ramen place in all of Boston, and luckily they’re currently in NYC at Ramen Lab. Ramen Lab is basically a ramen residency place that houses different ramen chefs from around the east coast. Yume is a place with a very pure mission, help their patrons accomplish their dreams. The mission is one that I want to keep doing for the rest of my life no matter what I end up doing.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"alumny-meetup\"><a href=\"#alumny-meetup\" aria-label=\"alumny meetup permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>AlumNY Meetup</h2>\n<p>On Sunday, HackNY brought together current and past fellows for a meetup in central park. I got to meet some really interesting fellows who are doing a wide range of thing from working at kickstarter to working at an education startup in Long Island. The weather was perfect for just hanging out and talking. In addition to that, I got to see Robert Glasper live, which was weird and kinda awesome. He’s a very out there kind of musician.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-projects\"><a href=\"#future-projects\" aria-label=\"future projects permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Future Projects</h2>\n<p>Here are some projects I’m going to start work on very soon: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>My own email application that remembers interactions and can suggest emails</li>\n<li>iOS ARKit tutorial</li>\n<li>Full stack app for shared groceries list and payment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"soundtrack-for-the-week\"><a href=\"#soundtrack-for-the-week\" aria-label=\"soundtrack for the week permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Soundtrack for the week</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQofcJ6L2Rk&#x26;list=PLDC60C815BE117301\">The Anthology</a> - A Tribe Called Quest</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqHbtOUZjdI\">Hella Personal Film Festival</a> - Open Mike Eagle</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFy1BMaYRh0\">The Stranger</a> - Billy Joel</p>"}
