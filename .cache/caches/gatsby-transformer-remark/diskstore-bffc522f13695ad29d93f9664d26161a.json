Before I do that, a quick project update:</p>\n<p>I decided this weekend that I’m going to have to spin up an AWS cluster in order to connect to google BigQuery. Though it was not my first choice, I’m pretty sure it’s the only way this project is going to work. I’m still going to have my frontend react server which will connect to it, but now i have to do some more config stuff on the backend. </p>\n<p>I plan to finish the rest of the work this week once I finish my other exams. </p>\n<p>This class has been very fun, I’ve loved working on all the different aspects of this course. Probably my favorite part of this class we’re the challenging and fun assignments. It’s been great getting to figure out the solutions to many of the problems, and finding an innovative answer. </p>\n<p>My favorite assignment may have been determining the season for a given date, or doing the second extra credit assignment (pulling data from an iMDB.) I loved the challenge of reading and interpreting text into data. I’m excited to use these skills over my coop and my job this summer.</p>"}
