## Short Short Reviews

### Captain America

You have to love the first Captain America movie, the premise is one of the best: let's make a super soldier to fight Hitler and the Nazis. The movie is a great introduction to the MCU as well; it shows us the begginnings of SHIELD, the start of the Avengers conflict, the start of HYDRA, and most importantly the first INFINITY stone!!! Something I forgot about this movie was how pure and good Steve Rogers is. It does a good job of showing that Rogers always has his head on straight even without powers. It's almost the opposite of Tony Stark's beginning. Tony is kinda everywhere until he finds his purpose with the creation of Iron Man.

### Agent Carter Season 1
	
People have plenty of complaints about Agent Carter, but I actually really enjoyed the show. Unlike a lost of episodes of Agents of SHIELD, Agent Carter's first seasons feels very connected in a very good way. Agent Carter also doesn't fall in to the trap of many other comic book shows of having a bunch of unneccesary episodes that add very little to the plot (@Arrow, @Flash.) Agent Carter, I feel, is a really interesting look into the pre-superhero era of the world, also the rampant sexism of the SSR, which Peggy Carter does a great job of being SUPER badass nonetheless. We also see a glimpse into black widow's upbringing in the USSR. A lot of this show is done right; killing off characters happens more than usual. 

### Agent Carter One Shot
	
This one shot was ehhhh as a result of it just feeling disconnected from everything. A theory I saw which made the whole thing WAY better was if the one shot were actually a propaganda film directed by Howard Stark in 50s. If this is actually a propaganda film, it would be AWESOME. Just a thing to show to new SSR or SHIELD members, how badass Peggy Carter is, and how sexism is not to be tolerated in this environment.

### Agent Carter Season 1

Agent carter season 2 had its ups and downs. It felt like it left a bit too much to the imagination, and a lot of loose ends. What happened to dottie? What's going to happen to Wilkes? What was the key for? The first season felt very succint in a lot of ways, and the second season left too much unanswered and too many plot holes. It would have been cool if they also explained the Zero Matter more, or maybe put in the context of the future Inhumans / Kree / Terragenesis. Overall, it was ehhhh

### Iron Man

This is one of my favorite Marvel movies to date. It's always in everyone's top 3 favorite Marvel movies, and it's definitely in mine. It's the move that started it all. Each part of the movie feels so good and RDJ IS SO perfect as tony stark it's crazy.

### Iron Man 2

There are some parts of Iron Man 2 that feel great and others that feel eh. It would have been better if they got a bit darker/ deeper with the connection between Venko and Stark (both the parents and their children), it probably would have created a better final battle. The final battle was also a bit underwhelming, they could have made it a bit more epic. Also the destruction that was happening in the park was a bit underplayed, and it would have been good if they mentioned things like injuries and other side effects of the battle. It would definitely have made Tony a better character in the overall MCU, it would have really contributed more to his regret and character choices in the later movies (i.e. Ultron and Civil war.)
