## Short Short Reviews

### Captain America

You have to love the first Captain America movie, the premise is one of the best: let's make a super soldier to fight Hitler and the Nazis. The movie is a great introduction to the MCU as well; it shows us the begginnings of SHIELD, the start of the Avengers conflict, the start of HYDRA, and most importantly the first INFINITY stone!!! Something I forgot about this movie was how pure and good Steve Rogers is. It does a good job of showing that Rogers always has his head on straight even without powers. It's almost the opposite of Tony Stark's beginning. Tony is kinda everywhere until he finds his purpose with the creation of Iron Man.

### Agent Carter Season 1
	
People have plenty of complaints about Agent Carter, but I actually really enjoyed the show. Unlike a lost of episodes of Agents of SHIELD, Agent Carter's first seasons feels very connected in a very good way. Agent Carter also doesn't fall in to the trap of many other comic book shows of having a bunch of unneccesary episodes that add very little to the plot (@Arrow, @Flash.) Agent Carter, I feel, is a really interesting look into the pre-superhero era of the world, also the rampant sexism of the SSR, which Peggy Carter does a great job of being SUPER badass nonetheless. We also see a glimpse into black widow's upbringing in the USSR. A lot of this show is done right; killing off characters happens more than usual. 

### Agent Carter One Shot
	
This one shot was ehhhh as a result of it just feeling disconnected from everything. A theory I saw which made the whole thing WAY better was if the one shot were actually a propaganda film directed by Howard Stark in 50s. If this is actually a propaganda film, it would be AWESOME. Just a thing to show to new SSR or SHIELD members, how badass Peggy Carter is, and how sexism is not to be tolerated in this environment.

### Agent Carter Season 1

Agent carter season 2 had its ups and downs. It felt like it left a bit too much to the imagination, and a lot of loose ends. What happened to dottie? What's going to happen to Wilkes? What was the key for? The first season felt very succint in a lot of ways, and the second season left too much unanswered and too many plot holes. It would have been cool if they also explained the Zero Matter more, or maybe put in the context of the future Inhumans / Kree / Terragenesis. Overall, it was ehhhh

### Iron Man

This is one of my favorite Marvel movies to date. It's always in everyone's top 3 favorite Marvel movies, and it's definitely in mine. It's the move that started it all. Each part of the movie feels so good and RDJ IS SO perfect as tony stark it's crazy.

### Iron Man 2

There are some parts of Iron Man 2 that feel great and others that feel eh. It would have been better if they got a bit darker/ deeper with the connection between Venko and Stark (both the parents and their children), it probably would have created a better final battle. The final battle was also a bit underwhelming, they could have made it a bit more epic. Also the destruction that was happening in the park was a bit underplayed, and it would have been good if they mentioned things like injuries and other side effects of the battle. It would definitely have made Tony a better character in the overall MCU, it would have really contributed more to his regret and character choices in the later movies (i.e. Ultron and Civil war.)

### The Incredible Hulk

I actually don't love this movie, the acting is ehhhh, and most of the tie ins are just Thaddeus Ross and SHIELD stuff, but even then it's just so aside from the plot it doesn't really seem that great. Also, I get annoyed by the fights in general, they just aren't that well coreographed/ planned out, and the Hulk's portrayal is only okay.

### The Consultant

The consultant was a cool way to introduce us to Sitwell, and also it was cool to see Tony Stark again being used by SHIELD. Other than that, it only okay, it just felt unneccesary.

### A Funny Thing Happened on the way to Thor's Hammer

Loved this one shot! It just showed Coulson being a bad ass person who really knows what to do in a tense situation. Coulson just keeps everything calm and underwraps, and carry's himself perfectly.

### Thor

I thought Thor was pretty good, it wasn't the best kind of goofy thor (@Ragnarok) but it was well lightharted, and introduced Thor really well, better than Hulk for sure. It was also great to see all of Coulson's busy week tied together neatly. Thor also introduced more of the MCU lore which I always love learning about.

### Avengers

Avengers was awesome, from start to finish it felt so succint. The way the different members of team interact feels very genuine; they all kinda hate each other to start. All throughout the movie they don't even get closer with one another. The only time they're a team is right when they need to be. When they finally get together, they realize that oh we're all on the same side. Little things that happen here and there are great; the little interactions between the side characters, and the mentions of some of what's to come. I like how they actually show Tony get hit to the ground right next to the shawarma place, which is why later he mentions it. I really like the interactions between Cap and Tony for a multitude of reasons. But basically, they are ALWAYS at each other's throats going after each other's core, but really only Tony is the one who changes. Cap calls tony out for only being in it for himself, and later he does the most selfless thing possible saving millions, not for the fame, but because it was the right thing.


### Item 47

This was a great little one shot, it used all of the characters that we're introduced and showed us what it was like being a part of the aftermath cleanup. It also showed that SHIELD is monitoring everything that's happening in the world. I like how they also just recruit talented people. The whole use of action sequences was really interesting. Overall it was probably the best one shot yet. 


### Iron Man 3

I love iron man 3 because its just shear nerdiness and obsession. Throughout the movie we see Tony going through what is basically PTSD from his traumatic experience and handling it pretty poorly. I love how we just get to really know tony more personally than ever before. This also acts as an amazing end to Tony's trilogy; we really get a sense of his journey and it does a great job of setting up his character for Ultron, Spiderman, and Civil War.

### All Hail The King

Loved this one shot because oh my god Ben Kingsley is just an amazing actor. We just got to see another corner of the world, and a continuation of the ten rings! I would love to see a movie where spiderman faces the ten rings as a continuation of Tony's legacy.


### Thor: The Dark World

Thor 2 was pretty good, better than the first. You could tell that the interactions and story line was better connected than last time. I also liked how we got more of an intro to the universe as a whole. It was also cool how Jane was more relevant in this story unlike other side characters in the past. Highlights: Sif and the warriors three. I loved all of their interactions and heroism throughout the movie, and would love to see a spin off of just their adventures.

### Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 1

Agents of Shield was actually way better than i thought it was going to be. There was some corny-ness here and there, but overall I actually enjoyed it. Each episode felt important to the whole story of Shield as a whole. I think the highlight though is the break that winter soldier caused. It would have been cooler if they had done it a bit later in the show so that we felt more attached to the main characters, and the twists and turns in the episode were better. 


### Captain America: The Winter Soldier

Loved this movie. SO much. I think that this was one of the best in the Captain America series. The whole plot of the movie, just the multitude of lies on top of secrets, etc. was done so well. I also like how connected it was to the rest of the universe. I think my favorite part was seeing agent Sitwell getting thrown off the building as our intro to Falcon. It got me more excited to see the rest of Agents of Shield. I also liked the post credits and their intro to what we're going to see in the shows and in Ultron.

### Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2

Season 2 was pretty good, but it was made ehhh by the flip flopping of the character relationships. One minute the characters love each other, next they hate each other. They keep making the same mistakes over and over again. The best parts of the show were Skye, Coulson and Fitz. But I really didn't like the parts with Bobbi and Mack. The whole "real SHIELD" twist felt like an unneccesary plot point and disrupted the swing of everything else happening. It would have been way better if they were together for everything. The episode where they attack the hydra base right before Ultron was amazing, Daisy's fight scene was one of the best in the show.

### Guardians of the Galaxy

I loved this movie sososo much. It was such a breath of fresh air for marvel, and superhero movies in general. It's campy, self aware, but still brilliant. They did a great job with character development and plot development while introducing a big plot point for the overall story ~~infinity stone~~. Benicio del toro was also amazing as the Collector, sorta menacing, but very strange. ALSO THIS EASILY HAD ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS OF ANY SUPERHERO MOVIE. I listen to it all of them.

### Daredevil Season 1

This is easily the best of the tv shows yet. I love how Matt is just so to the point, and in both of his careers he's an absolute badass. The relationships between Matt, Foggy, and Karen as well as the side relationship between Matt and Claire. But probably the best part was Fisk. He was perfectly cast, and played the role absolutely perfectly. I also love how they set him up to be the villain in the future. The fights were so well coordinated.

### Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2

Some people didn't love volume 2 that much, but I actually thought it was one of the best #2 movies of any of them. I loved how they developed Rocket into this very vulnerable character and the parallel they drew with Yondu was brilliant. I also thought it was great how Yondu was both a villain and a hero in this. With Yondu as a father figure to Quill and Yondu's similarity to Rocket, I'm excited to see how that dynamic plays out in the next films. The use of Ego, quill's father as the villain was great, and made better by using the idea of father figures to mirror the hatred that Gamora and Nebula feel. Oh and their relationship was also really interesting to see unfold. And on top of all of that they managed to squeeze in the Sovereign as another villain, and they're setting themselves up to be in the next guardians movie. Also they had an unbelievable soundtrack too.

### Jessica Jones Season 1

Jessica Jones to me was more about Killgrave than anything. He was just so goddamn devious and evil. I was incredibely impressed by David Tennant's acting abilities to just really make you hate him. Jessica was good, but her best parts were about the way she dealt with trauma and anxiety. I thought it was great noir filming though.

### Avengers: Age of Ultron

Age of Ultron isn't seen by the community as that great, but I thought it was really well done. I think the most important part of the movie was the trust between the characters. Seeing the cracks unfold between Tony and Steve was really important. In addition to that, seeing how Tony's goal is to protect the world via Ultron is really important to understanding what's going to happen in Civil War. I think ultron as a villain was ehhh, but his role overall was important. I also like how they introduced Klaue, and how Ultron accidentally cut off his arm.
