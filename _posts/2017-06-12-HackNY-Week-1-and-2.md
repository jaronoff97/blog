### HackNY Week 1

This was my first week of HackNY, and I loved it!!! I'm going to write this post by going over, first, the events that we went to, and then I'm going to talk about how i liked each of them

## Tech Talk 1: Rob Spectre

Rob Spectre, a programmer for the NYC counter human trafficking effort, came to talk to us about the work he does to prevent and/or catch human traffickers more effectively. His talk was not only powerful but also very eye opening. He, along with some ADA's showed us some cases and had us guess the sentences that the offenders got. Often times, we would think they would get 25-life sentences but in reality they only got a couple of years. At the end of his talk Rob showed us the efforts we, as programmers and fellows, could take this summer. He gave us a couple projects we could potentially work on. Many of the projects were simple scraping projects that even the simplest programmers could do. [Information on his team](http://manhattanda.org/dany-academy)

## Fellows Workshop 1: 

Today Will gave us a talk about his experience with programming at NYU's satellite campus in the UAE
