### DS 4100 Data Collection, Integration, and Analysis

[Course Website](http://ds4100.weebly.com)

Just like my [CS 3500](http://jaronoff.com/CS-3500-Day-1/) posts, this series is for my data science class notes. This class is what most of my R tutorial posts have been for (I'm going to continue those until I finish the book). Here are the units: 

* Unit 1 - Essentials Concepts of Data Science
* Unit 2 - Programming in R for Data Science
* Unit 3 - Data Collection & Integration
* Unit 4 - Data Storage
* Unit 5 - Data Analytics
* Unit 6 - Python Programming for Data Science
* Unit 7 - Data Quality & Governance

So it seems like we start with R, and **eventually** get to Python. The first part is all about the concepts. The teacher calls it "plumbing" the stuff about collection and integration. Getting data from SO many different sources (Files, JSON, XML, Scraping, APIs). Then we go to data storage in SQL and NoSQL. Then we leave "plumbing" and do data analytics: descriptive analytics and predictive analytics :) :) :) :); data mining, machine learning, etc (REALLY COOL STUFF). Then we do visualization and communicating results leading into building analytics reports. Then a little Python programming and checking the quality of data. It also sounds like this is a job prep kind of class where at the end I'll be job ready for DS.
