### DS 4100 Data Collection, Integration, and Analysis

Today we're talking more about SQL.

Three primary operations in relational database:

* Selection
	* retrieve specific rows from a table
* Projection
	* retrieve specific columns from a table
* Join
	* combine multiple tables

The basic schema for a query is as follows:

~~~ sql
SELECT 	<attribute list>
FROM 	<table list>
WHERE 	<condition>
GROUP BY <column>
HAVING <search-condition>
ORDER BY <column>;
~~~

## Column Calculation

In SQL it's possible to calculate columns on the fly:

~~~ sql
SELECT city, region, 
       (revenue - budget),
       month (sales_date)
  FROM Sales
 WHERE (revenue - budget) < 0;

SELECT t_qty, t_cost, 
       (t_qty * t_cost) vol
  FROM Trade
 WHERE vol > 10000;
~~~

In the second query, we're giving the calculation (t_qty * t_cost) the column name vol, and then using that in our **WHERE** clause.
Also! Important to note that order can change!

In basic mathematics, join does a cartesian product. 

## Joining

~~~ sql
SELECT inv_name, p_desc
  FROM investor i, portfolio p
 WHERE i.inv_id = p.inv_id;
~~~

Here, we're joining the investor and their portfolio.

There's also NATURAL JOIN, which joins by fields that have the same name:

~~~ sql
SELECT p_id, p_value, inv_name
  FROM portfolio 
  NATURAL JOIN investor;

~~~

## Like selection

~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM investment
WHERE i_name LIKE 'D%';
~~~


## Grouping

~~~ sql
SELECT i_id, AVG (t_qty*t_cost)
  FROM Trade
GROUP BY i_id;

SELECT i_id, AVG (t_qty*t_cost)
  FROM Trade
 WHERE p_id = 300
GROUP BY i_id;

~~~

Just throw a bunch of similar things together.

## Range:

~~~ sql
SELECT t_date, t_qty
  FROM Trade
 WHERE t_date 
 BETWEEN 'JAN-01-95' AND 'DEC-31-95';
~~~

## Set membership

~~~ sql
SELECT i_name, i_price
  FROM Investment
 WHERE i_name 
    IN ('IBM', 'DEC', 'MSFT');

SELECT i_name, i_price
  FROM Investment
 WHERE i_name 
NOT IN ('IBM', 'DEC', 'MSFT');

~~~

## Null

~~~ sql
SELECT t_name, t_qty
  FROM Trade
 WHERE t_date IS NULL
   AND t_qty IS NOT NULL; 
~~~


## Union

~~~ sql
SELECT t_id, t_cost
  FROM Trade
 WHERE t_cost > 10
UNION
SELECT p_id,  pos_value
  FROM Position
 WHERE pos_value > 10000;
~~~

* In order to ‘union’ two tables, they must:
	* have the same number of columns
	* the columns must be of the same data type
	* the columns must have values from the same domains
* Union acts as an “append” - the data in one table is appended to the bottom of the other.

## Subqueries

* The subquery is an important SQL multi-table query facility:
	* natural way to express queries
	* easier to write than join SELECTs
	* allows a query to be broken down
	* some queries cannot be defined without subqueries

~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM investment
 WHERE i_id IN 
   (SELECT i_id FROM trade
    WHERE t_qty > 1000);
~~~

~~~ sql
SELECT t_id, t_qty
  FROM Trade
 WHERE t_qty > (SELECT AVG(pos_qty)
                  FROM Position);
~~~

~~~ sql
SELECT t_id
  FROM trade
 WHERE t_qty*t_cost > ANY
         (SELECT p_value
            FROM portfolio);
~~~
