### DS 4100 Data Collection, Integration, and Analysis

Like my OOD posts, I wasn't here in class for day 4, so I'm skipping right to day 5. Today/ this week we're doing data importing from multiple sources as well as scraping. We started by importing CSVs and txt files. Now we're going to import from other normal files, JSON, and XML. Eventually we're going to be getting data from databases.


### Packages

Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compield code in a well-defined format. It's important where packages are stored.

Functions to use with packages:

* **.libPaths()**
* **library()** to list all installed packages
* **search()** to list currently loaded packages
* **require()** to load a package for use

Use **install.packages()** to install a package

We can load most file formats:

* .csv
* .txt
* .xls
* .xlsx
* .RData

Package called "foreign" that allows R to load data from stata, SPSS, SAS, MATLAB, etc. Data is located in folders, so be sure a working directory is set.

### Data

use **file.exists** to see if a file exists, use **dir.create** to create a directory.

~~~ R
download.file("FILEURL", destfile="DESTINATION_PATH", method="curl")
~~~

When a file is loaded its content are stored in the computer's RAM, R is default 32 bit, so you need to specify 64bit to hold more data. When "big data" needs to be analyzed use a database! Files can also take a long time to load. 

CSV doesn't have a standard file format so you have to be careful when your read from a CSV. If there are double quotes surrounding a string in a CSV R will take them as the literal value. You can actually specify the seperator in **read.csv** which is kind of ironic cause it's COMMA SEPERATED VALUES. There's also read.table which read.csv is basically a wrapper around.

~~~ R
library(xlsx)
people <- read.xlsx("some.xlsx", sheetIndex=1)
~~~

It's best to use CSV, because XLS and XLSX are proprietary. Saving R objects in .RData files is fast and convenient but is not compatible AT ALL with other programs.
