### Object Oriented Design

This is my first post for OOD, I'm going to be using this as a place to take notes and write code.


They say to use IntteliJ but like almost everything else I'm going to try and only use Sublime Text. I may have to make custom build scripts to match intelliJ projects, but I hate Android Studio (an IntelliJ fork) so I'm really going to try and steer clear from that.

## Thoughts

Looks like it'll be a good semester. One of the main projects of the semester is making a musicplayer (which I've already done in java) so that'll be really fun. Also excited to see javascript at the end of the semester as that's always a mess. It also seems like they're going to have another git tutorial **:(**.
