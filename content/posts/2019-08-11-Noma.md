I was lucky enough to go Noma at the end of my European travels, and it was INCREDIBLE. Noma was voted the second best restaurant in the world this year, and held its status as a two michelin star restaurant as well. Each dish served has an aspect of fermentation in it, and everything is made with local ingredients. 

The experience my friend and I had there cannot be compared to any other meal I've ever had. The meal itself filled my friend and me with glee and curiousity. My friend and I consider ourselves pretty adept at tasting; we cook often and are very adventurous, but this meal was totally beyond our knowledge. Each dish was constructed with ingredients that were familiar, but prepared in ways that were absolutely crazy. It almost felt like we were watching a magic show, trying to figure out how they did it. Luckily, every watier there had an in depth knowledge of each dish so that we could learn about it. 

In addition to the meal itself, I also ordered the juice pairing which comes with a variety of juices that they make in house to pair specifically with different sections of the menu. The juices were also absolutely insane. As someone who loves cocktails and fermented drinks, I was in heaven. More on these later.
