### Object Oriented Design

Today we're moving onto controllers, the C in MVC. 

The controller takes input from the user and decides what to do.

Controllers:

* Glue of the system
* Controls how and when the model is used
* Controls what must be shown to the view and when (in some cases)
* Controls what action must be taken when user interacts with system (in some cases)
* Controls the sequence of operations in an application(in some cases)

The view should **NEVER** talk directly to the model (and vice versa). The controller is the middle man. 

MVC Pattern:

* Model: Offers actual operations
	* Oblivious to when they are needed and how to present results
* View: Presents results
	* Oblivious to how they are produced or what to do next
* Controller: Delegates to model and view
	* Oblivious to how model completes the operations or how specifically the view shows output

Our next assignment is going to be the controller of Freecell. Our FreecellController looks like this:

FreeCellController: 

* “Controls” the game
* Uses the model and the view in specific sequence
	* Determines when to ask for user input
	* Determines when to use which operation of model
	* Determines when to show output to the view
* The sequence of the game is determined by the controller, not the user


Synchronous Controllers

* Determines the sequence of operations of the system
* Determines when and how the system interacts with something external
* Suitable for pre-baked “rules-based” applications, like games
* Challenges:
	* How to truly separate controller from view so each one is replacable?
	* What to do when system is reactive in nature (to user input)?
		* User interaction decides program behavior, not controller
		* Examples: Microsoft Word, IntelliJ

Synchronicity happens like 1->2->3->4. There's an order to events. Synchronous tells the user to do something and then gets input. Asynch gets input and does something.

Asynchronous Controllers

* Controller gets control when external input is given
* Controller methods are called as a response to external input
* Such methods in the controller are called callbacks
* GUI programs typically work this way
	* User clicks a button, moves the mouse ⇒ a controller method is called
	* In OO GUIs, callbacks are often wrapped in classes called listeners
* Look at MVCExample code

In most Java projects, the **main** method creates everything. For example: 

~~~ java
public class MainRunner {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     IModel theModel = makeAModel();
     IView aView = makeAView();
     IController theController = makeController(theModel, aView);
     theController.go();
   }
}
~~~

How do we show output? The simplest way is to just use **System.out.print**. To get input we use a **Scanner**. Now we're going an in class example. 

~~~ java
public class SimpleCalc1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num1, num2;
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    num1 = scan.nextInt();
    num2 = scan.nextInt();
    System.out.printf("%d", num1 + num2);
  }
}
~~~

Let's turn this into an MVC example:

~~~ java
public class SimpleCalc2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num1, num2;
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    num1 = scan.nextInt();
    num2 = scan.nextInt();
    System.out.printf("%d", new Calculator().add(num1, num2));
  }
}

class Calculator {
  public int add(int num1, int num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
  }
}
~~~

Let's add a controller:

~~~ java
public class SimpleCalc1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Calculator model = new Calculator();
    CalcController controller = new CalcController(model);
    controller.go();
  }
}
class CalcController {
  private final Calculator model;

  public CalcController(Calculator model){
    this.model = model;
  }
  public void go(){
    int num1, num2;
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter a number: ");
    num1 = scan.nextInt();
    System.out.println("Enter another number: ");
    num2 = scan.nextInt();
    System.out.printf("The answer is: %d", model.add(num1, num2));
  }
}
class Calculator {
  public int add(int num1, int num2){
    return num1+num2;
  }
}
~~~

Now we're running into issues with testing. How do you test something that takes input and output? We need to set a **System.in** and a **System.out**. In order to make this work we add an input stream and output stream property to our class:

~~~ java
class CalcController {
  private final Calculator model;
  private InputStream input;
  private OutputStream output;

  public CalcController(Calculator model) {
    this.model = model;
    this.input = System.in;
    this.output = System.out;
  }

  public CalcController(Calculator model, InputStream input, OutputStream output) {
    this.model = model;
    this.input = input;
    this.output = output;
  }

	public void go() {
  	  int num1, num2;
  	  Scanner scan = new Scanner(input);
  	  output.println("Enter a number: ");
  	  num1 = scan.nextInt();
  	  output.println("Enter another number: ");
  	  num2 = scan.nextInt();
  	  output.printf("The answer is: %d", model.add(num1, num2));
  	}
}
~~~

Now for the test:

~~~ java
public class CalcControllerTest {
  @Test
  public void go() throws Exception {
    Calculator model = new Calculator();
    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    PrintStream printStream = new PrintStream(baos);
    ByteArrayInputStream byteArrayInputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream("6\n 8\n".getBytes());
    CalcController controller = new CalcController(model, byteArrayInputStream, printStream);
    controller.go();
    assertEquals(baos.toString(), "Enter a number: \n"
            + "Enter another number: \n"
            + "The answer is: 14");
  }

}
