I'm a software engineer at Drift, where I work on making our platform more reliable. I worked for Datadog on their Alerting team as an intern in 2017, and as a co-op in 2018, where I developed Go and Python services using Kafka, elasticsearch, and Cassandra. I currently attend Northeastern University's College of Computer and Information Science as a Computer Science major. I serve as the president of [NU Hacks](https://nuhacks.io). I'm a hackNY 2017 fellow, and interact 2018 fellow. I served as a mentor for the hackNY fellowship program in 2018, planning a multitude of activities, speaker events, and projects. I'm the director for [hackNY's hackathon](https://hackny.org/hackathon/). Outside of work, [I love to cook, bake, and bartend](https://instagram.com/ehicouldeat), you can read more about that [here](https://ehicouldeat.com).
