The reason this is the 16th, and not the 15th, is because one day of class was cancelled and I wasn't at another, this will be the same case for my DS 4100 notes. 

Today we're going over the adapter pattern, which is pretty cool and gross (classic OOD java), but i dont really need to learn it again, so i'm not going to take notes on it.
