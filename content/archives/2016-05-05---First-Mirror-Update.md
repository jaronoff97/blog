## First Mirror Update
Hello! This is my first post involving my smart mirror project!

I've been looking into which parts to buy for the project and here's my running list:

* HP Pavilion 21.5-Inch IPS LED HDMI VGA Monitor [^1]
* CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 with 2.5A Micro USB Power Supply (UL Listed) [^2]
* Mirror?

[^2]: <http://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Micro-Supply-Listed/dp/B01C6FFNY4/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1462152555&sr=1-3&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+model+b>

Right now, I'm not sure which order I should do this project in:
	Start with software and then build it in the mirror
	Start with the hardware and then make the software work

I guess I'll decide that once I get the mirror (which I'll be getting when I go to Home Depot, fingers crossed)
