From what a lot of my friends have told me R is a pretty crappy language, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see what the language holds.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to be following the Hands-On Programming with R
To follow these tutorials, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using the R repl (I installed a package in Sublime Text to handle all of that).</description></item><item><title>Part 1, Welcome to Swift</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2016-05-17-welcome-to-swift/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2016-05-17-welcome-to-swift/</guid><description>Welcome to Swift! Swift is my favorite programming language right now for a bunch of reasons. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with a statically-typed language like Java, C, or C++, Swift will come as a breath of fresh air. Swift is a statically-typed, type-inferred language. This tutorial is meant for more experienced programmers, you should have a good understanding of either a statically-typed language like Java or a great understanding of a dynamically-typed language like Python.</description></item><item><title>Part 1, Welcome to python</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2016-05-10-welcome-to-python/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2016-05-10-welcome-to-python/</guid><description>Welcome to Python! Python is a really great programming language, thats easy to learn and fun to use. In order to write python code, you have two options. You can use what&amp;rsquo;s called interactive mode which is done by going to terminal and typing
{% highlight bash %} python {% endhighlight %}
You should see the following pop up:
{% highlight bash %} Python 2.7 (#1, Feb 28 2010, 00:02:06) Type &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;copyright&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;credits&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;license&amp;rdquo; for more information.</description></item></channel></rss>
