Noma was voted the second best restaurant in the world this year, and held its status as a two michelin star restaurant as well. Each dish served has an aspect of fermentation in it, and everything is made with local ingredients.
The experience my friend and I had there cannot be compared to any other meal I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.</description></item><item><title>Final Week in Germany And Abroad</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-08-06-final-week-in-germany-and-abroad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-08-06-final-week-in-germany-and-abroad/</guid><description>Berlin Berlin is a really incredible city. We got in midday on Thursday and spent the day just walking around. We found a cute little bakery, and sat down at a bar/cafe outside again just letting the world go by. The next day we had class where two presenters came in to talk to us about project management. After class, some friends and I went to a great little japanese restaurant where we got some sushi, then back to the bar/cafe we went to the previous day.</description></item><item><title>Second and Third Weeks in Germany</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-25-second-and-third-weeks-in-germany/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-25-second-and-third-weeks-in-germany/</guid><description>More on Munich One of my favorite parts about Munich, is that it&amp;rsquo;s a lot bigger than it seems. Venturing to new restaurants has brought me to tons of new areas. One of my favorite areas I&amp;rsquo;ve been to was this cute little italian cafe where I got a perfect espresso, and then outside the cafe was a perfect little garden with a beautiful fountain in the middle.
Each area has a similar feeling with some slight differences, but probably the biggest distinguishing factor is the caf√©s, the flowers, and the people.</description></item><item><title>24 Hours in NYC</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-15-24-hours-in-nyc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-15-24-hours-in-nyc/</guid><description>Mistakes of the past In 2018, I ran my first 24 hour food tour in NYC. I was going to take the hackNY fellows around the whole city to some new places and some favorites. Although we went to some great places, I totally miscalculated the timing. We went from 8pm to 8pm, saturday to sunday. By 5 am everyone was tired, full, and inebriated. I kept trucking, and got a total of 1 and a half hours of sleep, waking up at 8am, ready to go.</description></item><item><title>First Week in Germany and Some Reflection</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-14-first-week-in-germany-and-some-reflection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-14-first-week-in-germany-and-some-reflection/</guid><description>Being in Munich Munich is a really incredible city! The trains here are reliable, go everywhere in the city and the suburbs, and are actually fast. In addition to the trains, there are tons of bikers and very few cars in the center of the city, making it a great city to walk in. There also bike lanes everywhere, that are pretty clearly marked. One of my favorite things is seeing many bikers lined up waiting for the lights to change, something I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anywhere in the states.</description></item><item><title>Joining Drift</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-06-23-joining-drift/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-06-23-joining-drift/</guid><description>Life Update Last month, I made the decision to join Drift full time as a software engineer beginning in 2020.

The group is approaching 1 million members. I used to be an avid member of the group, posting the occaisional dog pic, enjoying some of the funny memes on the page everynow and then.
I was sitting in a cafe in Cape Cod when I spotted two ducks who were getting very close to my table.</description></item><item><title>Marvel Milestones</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2018-01-02-marvel-milestones/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2018-01-02-marvel-milestones/</guid><description>Marvel Things!
