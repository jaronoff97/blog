Having avoided touching react for a while, being able to write some pretty simple HTML on top of an elixir backend is a wonderful experience. Local development is simple, but how one goes about preparing and deploying their Phoenix app for Kubernetes is a whole other process.</description></item><item><title>hackNY, hackathons, and COVID – what comes next?</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2020-11-17-hackny-updated/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2020-11-17-hackny-updated/</guid><description>reposted from my medium, because I don&amp;rsquo;t use medium
Hello World! I’m writing this to let you know that the hackNY hackathon is not returning for now. We’ve thought a lot about this decision, and hopefully this post will explain more about our conclusion. I cannot thank our alumni and volunteers enough for the many hours they put in to helping run our event.
Why am I writing this post, you may be wondering.</description></item><item><title>Recursive Argo Page Crawlers</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2020-10-31-recursive-argo-page-crawler/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2020-10-31-recursive-argo-page-crawler/</guid><description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work in kubernetes using Argo Workflows. Argo is a hyper powerful tool for running complex jobs, and allows you to run easily parallelized and templated code. One great use case for Argo are for running jobs of unknown length to parallelize data uploads and transformations. Unfortunately very little documentation / examples exist in order to help you do that, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d share that here in case there&amp;rsquo;s anyone grepping around the internet like I was.</description></item><item><title>Transportation Course</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2020-08-02-transportation-course/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2020-08-02-transportation-course/</guid><description>This summer (2020) for my final semester of college, I took two courses related to transportation, which has quickly become a huge passion of mine.

Noma was voted the second best restaurant in the world this year, and held its status as a two michelin star restaurant as well. Each dish served has an aspect of fermentation in it, and everything is made with local ingredients.
The experience my friend and I had there cannot be compared to any other meal I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.</description></item><item><title>Final Week in Germany And Abroad</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-08-06-final-week-in-germany-and-abroad/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-08-06-final-week-in-germany-and-abroad/</guid><description>Berlin Berlin is a really incredible city. We got in midday on Thursday and spent the day just walking around. We found a cute little bakery, and sat down at a bar/cafe outside again just letting the world go by. The next day we had class where two presenters came in to talk to us about project management. After class, some friends and I went to a great little japanese restaurant where we got some sushi, then back to the bar/cafe we went to the previous day.</description></item><item><title>Second and Third Weeks in Germany</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-25-second-and-third-weeks-in-germany/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-25-second-and-third-weeks-in-germany/</guid><description>More on Munich One of my favorite parts about Munich, is that it&amp;rsquo;s a lot bigger than it seems. Venturing to new restaurants has brought me to tons of new areas. One of my favorite areas I&amp;rsquo;ve been to was this cute little italian cafe where I got a perfect espresso, and then outside the cafe was a perfect little garden with a beautiful fountain in the middle.
Each area has a similar feeling with some slight differences, but probably the biggest distinguishing factor is the cafés, the flowers, and the people.</description></item><item><title>24 Hours in NYC</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-15-24-hours-in-nyc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-15-24-hours-in-nyc/</guid><description>Mistakes of the past In 2018, I ran my first 24 hour food tour in NYC. I was going to take the hackNY fellows around the whole city to some new places and some favorites. Although we went to some great places, I totally miscalculated the timing. We went from 8pm to 8pm, saturday to sunday. By 5 am everyone was tired, full, and inebriated. I kept trucking, and got a total of 1 and a half hours of sleep, waking up at 8am, ready to go.</description></item><item><title>First Week in Germany and Some Reflection</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-14-first-week-in-germany-and-some-reflection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-07-14-first-week-in-germany-and-some-reflection/</guid><description>Being in Munich Munich is a really incredible city! The trains here are reliable, go everywhere in the city and the suburbs, and are actually fast. In addition to the trains, there are tons of bikers and very few cars in the center of the city, making it a great city to walk in. There also bike lanes everywhere, that are pretty clearly marked. One of my favorite things is seeing many bikers lined up waiting for the lights to change, something I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anywhere in the states.</description></item><item><title>Joining Drift</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-06-23-joining-drift/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/posts/2019-06-23-joining-drift/</guid><description>Life Update Last month, I made the decision to join Drift full time as a software engineer beginning in 2020.

This is my fourth post involving my smart mirror project!
Sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a post recently, all of my work last week was non-post related. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my mirror&amp;rsquo;s software. I&amp;rsquo;ve got facial recognition working really well, it can recognize as many faces as there are in a picture with very good accuracy. I&amp;rsquo;ve also got finger recognition working well, it&amp;rsquo;s not near as good as facial recognition but its alright.</description></item><item><title>Third Mirror Update</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2016-05-16-third-mirror-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/2016-05-16-third-mirror-update/</guid><description>Third Mirror Update Hello! This is my third post involving my smart mirror project!
All the parts came in last week, and I spent the weekend setting up my raspberry pi with openCV, so that I could do facial recognition.
Using a bunch of tutorials online, I succesfully installed openCV 3 on my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ for python 2.7 AND python 3 1
After openCV was done, I turned my raspberry pi into a git server so I could work on the code on my computer.</description></item><item><title>First Mirror Update</title><link>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/archives/first-mirror-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jaronoff97.github.io/archives/archives/first-mirror-update/</guid><description>First Mirror Update Hello!

The parts have been bought!
I got the raspberry pi and monitor I mentioned in the last post. In addition to that I got an 8mp, 1080p camera for my Raspberry Pi.
I also got and constructed the two-way mirror component. I bought a 30&amp;rsquo; by 36&amp;rsquo; piece of glass and a big roll of two-way mirror film.</description></item></channel></rss>
