This was a fun assignment that I got to do in Python. I had a couple of ideas for this assignment, but I was able to decide upon scraping reddit. Reddit has an api, however, this assignment specified that we scrape HTML. I&rsquo;m really interested in eventually doing sentiment analysis; how does what someone says affect the amount of points they get?</p><p>This was a fun project because I got to build a lot of functionality from nothing. I started with the basics: get the page in Python. Once I had the page in Python, I went through the basics. First, I found the different links to the comments pages. I did this by using chrome to find a common trait shared between the comments links. Often times it was a class shared by the text. Once I had the class I would make a method that got all the instances of this property. I then chained each of these properties with methods like so: get the pages > get the comment blocks > get the [user, comment, points]. I would then run this through another method which would go through x amount of pages. This amount of pages would vary based on the amount of data that I wanted.</p><p>To begin these tests, I started with one page. After fixing all the issues from that, I moved on to ten pages. After ten, I expanded it to 100. Once that was done, I had a relatively large data set ~17832 rows. This sort of scraping proved effective. I was worried that I was missing a lot of data, so I went to the actual link to do a sanity check. I found that my scraper was getting everything correct. I really enjoyed this project, and I&rsquo;m excited to expand on it in the next assignment.</p><p>In the future, I think I would want to turn this into a real website. I would want to program it in Django, so that I could reuse my code for right now. Actually, if I were to turn this into a website I would use the reddit API, which I assume would be much faster than the scraping I&rsquo;m currently doing. I&rsquo;d also want to pair up with someone in the data visualizations class. I&rsquo;d be interested to pair up the data I get with some really beautiful live visualizations that update in real time. I&rsquo;d also be interested in opening up the website so that people could make their own visualizations with data set. I feel like that may be pretty difficult, however, because I&rsquo;d either have to make a way for people to code with given data or make a drag and drop interface with basic mathematical operations. Either way, i think it could turn into an interesting project.</p></section><footer class="mt-12 flex flex-wrap"><a class="mr-1.5 mb-1.5 rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] px-5 py-2 no-underline dark:bg-white/[8%]" href=https://jaronoff97.github.io/tags/ds>DS</a>
